NAME
       mksfx.sh - make SelFeXtractor archive

SYNOPSIS
       mksfx.sh [-x sfxname] [-c compression] [-r runname] [directory]

OPTIONS
       directory
              name of the directory to compress (default : current directory)

       -x sfxname, --sfx=sfxname
              file name to create (default : same as for directory)

       -c compression, --compress=compression
              compression method, could be : gzip, bzip2 (default : gzip)

       -r runname, --run=runname
              name of the file to run after uncompressing (default : run.sh)

DESCRIPTION
       Compress the archived content of a directory, then add an autoextract head to the file, so it will look and act as a bash(1) script. The executable head is
       kept small and simple, so there are no paranoia checkings included.

       When the current directory is comperessed, the script will exclude itself from the archive.

       When the selfextractor is executed, it's header part will decompress it's data part to a random named temporary directory in the /tmp/ directory, then if an
       autorun script exist, will run it.

SEE ALSO
       bash(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), tar(1);  sed(1), grep(1), mktemp(1)

TO DO
       Is somehow strange the use of the temporary directory, so it probably will be made optional. Also optionally some integrity check would be nice.

BUGS
       No bugs until now. Found bugs can be reported to the author.
