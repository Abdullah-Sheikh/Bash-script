=head1 NAME

B<termclock.sh> - draws an analog clock from letters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<termclock.sh>

=head1 OPTIONS

none

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Analog clock displayed using only bash(1) arithmetics and tput(1).

This makes the roundings abit rough.

The script uses sleep(1) or usleep(1) for pausing bitween ticks to make the movement smoother. But their existance or capability is not a requirement.

=head1 SEE ALSO

bash(1), tput(1), terminfo(5), sleep(1), usleep(1)

=head1 TO DO

Make the hands to look less dashed.

I could borrow some options from xclock(1) to set the look and feel.

=head1 BUGS

No bugs until now. Found bugs can be reported to the author.

=head1 COPYRIGHT

Use it healthy.
