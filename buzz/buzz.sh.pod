=head1 DESCRIPTION

Schedules an at(1) job to pop up a message using various commands.

Currently the following commands are supported : xmessage(1), Xdialog(1), kdialog(1), gdialog(1), zenity(1), xterm(1), eterm(1), aterm(1), terminal(1), konsole(1). If
none of the commands is found, the message be simply written to B<stdout>, letting the daemon to deliver it to the local mailbox.

This script was optimized for simplicity, there is no explicit configuration. However the order of checking for the above commands and the predefined message can be
easily modified in the script itself.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item B<DISPLAY>

The value of the current DISPLAY is set for the job. If not set, displaying the message by the atd(8) will probably fail.
